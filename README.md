# A Simple DB Inteface for Python

This is a very simple database interface for Python. It aims to make using Python to interact with a database easier, by removing the necessity to write actual database queries. It doesn't have every feature of SQL databases in it, but it should get better. Also, that's the price you pay for not knowing SQL. 

Right now, it only works for SQLite, but soon it should work with Postgres. It should also gain other features in time, but it's currently in its infancy.
